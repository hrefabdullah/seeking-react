#Day1 - 9 Dec 2024
Learning React

Understood :
  - Setting up React
  - Basics Structure
  - useStates

Outcome :
Based on todays learning I created a simple welcome page where it shows a name. I've used usestates to make changes with the react, therefore made a random name generator with an array of couple of names and change the name when button is clicked.

#Day2 - 10 Dec 2024

Understood :
  - Learned and applied Tailwind CSS
  - two-way binding
  - form handling

Outcome : 
Based on today's learning I recreated the welcome page using Tailwind CSS, updated functionalities and enhanced the design. I added a navbar and a simple form to learn form handling and two-way handling. Hence I changed the previous 'Change user' button and let the form which ask for a username update the name and the logo name when 'continue' button is clicked. 


#Day3 - 11 Dec 2024 

Understood :
  - Components
  - Rendering JSON data
  - Props drilling
  - API integration
  - useEffects
  - Some Scrollbar tricks

Outcome : 
Based on today's Learning I added two components.In the first one, got some JSON data from ChatGPT and rendred it into our project. In the second, I used external API (from newsapi.org) integrating it using useEffects and advanced concepts of Javascript (Async Await). I removed the scrollbar for the 2 sections i made today and doing this, users will not have to see the scrollbar but still use scrolling functionality

#Day4 - 12 Dec 2024

Understood :
  - Routing and routes
  - React Routing DOM
  - Revised previous concepts

Outcome : 
Based on today's learning I used React Routing DOM and Changed 90% of the project I'm working on. The Simple looking web page has now become more complex as now it has a responsive navbar, routing through different pages (home, about, contact, Courses) and use of External API. Also did some work on changing user form.
