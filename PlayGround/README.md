#Day1
Learning React

Understood :
  - Setting up React
  - Basics Structure
  - usestates

Outcome :
Based on todays learning I created a simple welcome page where it shows a name. I've used usestates to make changes with the react, therefore made a random name generator with an array of couple of names and change the name when button is clicked.
