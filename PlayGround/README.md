#Day1 - 9 Dec 2024
Learning React

Understood :
  - Setting up React
  - Basics Structure
  - usestates

Outcome :
Based on todays learning I created a simple welcome page where it shows a name. I've used usestates to make changes with the react, therefore made a random name generator with an array of couple of names and change the name when button is clicked.

#Day2 - 10 Dec 2024

Understood :
  - Learned and applied Tailwind CSS
  - two-way binding
  - form handling

Outcome : 
Based on today's learning I recreated the welcome page using Tailwind CSS, updated functionalities and enhanced the design. I added a navbar and a simple form to learn form handling and two-way handling. Hence I changed the previous 'Change user' button and let the form which ask for a username update the name and the logo name when 'continue' button is clicked.
